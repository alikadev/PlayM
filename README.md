To build and run this application, you will need theses programs:

- `cc` (build only)
- `SDL2-Mixer` (dev for build)

- `git` (clone the repository)

After installing these dependencies, you can clone the repository and run the Make script

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/alikadev/PlayM.git && cd PlayM
make
```

Your binary will be in the `PlayM` directory. If it doesn't work, try to find if your environement have a problem. If it still doesn't work, contact me!

After all of that, you can just execute the `playm` binary or set it up for your environement. There are no `Install` script because this application is not really ready to be shipped yet.
